# Traffic-Sign-Classifier
Udacity SDC nanodegree project for classifying traffic signs

In this project, I use a convolutional neural network in order to classify traffic signs.

Included in this project are some preprocessing techniques including grayscaling, normalizing, and adding additional data.
Additional data was generated by adding rotations of the original images.
